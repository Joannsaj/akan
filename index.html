      <h1>What is your <strong>AKAN</strong> name?</h1>
      <p>Akan names are of Ghanian origin. Children are given first names basing on what day of the week they are born. Names change for different days of the week but they also change for different genders. That is, a female born on Monday won't have the same name as a male born on Monday.</p>
      <p>So as we know most people know their dates of birth but not what day they were born, this here is to help you figure that out and tell you your Akan name.</p>
